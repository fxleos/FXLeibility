	abstract = {The residential sector is a major contributor to the global energy balance. So far, the residential users demand has been largely uncontrollable and inelastic with respect to the power grid conditions. Demand Side Management (DSM) is an important function in smart grid that allows consumers to make informed decision regarding energy consumption, and helps energy providers to reshape the load profile and to reduce peak load demand. DSM can be mathematically formulated either to maximize the system total peak demand or to maximize overall system load factor and utility's revenue and to minimize customer electricity bill. This paper reviews the various optimization techniques applied to DSM as contrasting characteristics like individual users versus cooperative users, deterministic versus stochastic and day-ahead versus real time DSM. This paper reviews a survey on residential DSM, which can help general readers to have an outlook of the topic which includes the architecture, formulation of optimization problems and its various approaches. The issues, existing solutions and approaches are presented. In addition, the future research directions are also discussed to enhance the work in this domain.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a well-founded quantified estimation of the demand response flexibility of residential smart appliances. The flexibility from five types of appliances available within residential premises (washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers, domestic hot water buffers and electric vehicles), is quantified based on measurements from the LINEAR pilot, a large-scale research and demonstration project focused on the introduction of demand response at residential premises in the Flanders region in Belgium. The flexibility potential of the smart appliances, or the maximal amount of time a certain increase or decrease of power can be realized within the comfort requirements of the user, is calculated. In general, the flexibility potential varies during the day, and the potential for increasing or decreasing the power consumption is in general not equal. Additionally, an extrapolation of the flexibility potential of wet appliances is presented for Belgium. The analysis shows that, using smart wet appliances, an average maximum increase of 430. W per household can be realized at midnight, and a maximum decrease of 65. W per household can be realized in the evening. The resulting flexibility potential can be used as an instrument to determine the impact or economic viability of demand response programs for residential premises.},

	abstract = {The electric power industry landscape is continually evolving. As emerging technologies such as wind and solar generating systems become more cost effective, traditional power system operating strategies will need to be re-evaluated. The presence of wind and solar generation (commonly referred to as variable generation or VG) can increase variability and uncertainty in the net-load profile. One mechanism to mitigate this issue is to schedule and dispatch additional operating reserves. These operating reserves aim to ensure that there is enough capacity online in the system to account for the increased variability and uncertainty occurring at finer temporal resolutions. A new operating reserve strategy, referred to as flexibility reserve, has been introduced in some regions. A similar implementation is explored in this study, and its implications on power system operations are analysed. Results show that flexibility reserve products can improve economic metrics, particularly in significantly reducing the number of scarcity pricing events, with minimal impacts on reliability metrics and production costs. The production costs increased due to increased VG curtailment – i.e. including the flexible ramping product in the commitment of excess thermal capacity that needed to remain online at the expense of VG output.},

	abstract = {By 2050, the European Union aims to reduce greenhouse gases by more than 80{\%}. The EU member states have therefore declared to strongly increase the share of renewable energy sources (RES-E) in the next decades. Given a large deployment of wind and solar capacities, there are two major impacts on electricity systems: First, the electricity system must be flexible enough to cope with the volatile RES-E generation, i.e., ramp up supply or ramp down demand on short notice. Second, sufficient back-up capacities are needed during times with low feed-in from wind and solar capacities. This paper analyzes whether there is a need for additional incentive mechanisms for flexibility in electricity markets with a high share of renewables. For this purpose, we simulate the development of the European electricity markets up to the year 2050 using a linear investment and dispatch optimization model. Flexibility requirements are implemented in the model via ramping constraints and provision of balancing power. We found that an increase in fluctuating renewables has a tremendous impact on the volatility of the residual load and consequently on the flexibility requirements. However, any market design that incentivizes investments in least (total system) cost generation investment does not need additional incentives for flexibility. The main trigger for investing in flexible resources is the achievable full load hours and the need for backup capacity. In a competitive market, the cost-efficient technologies that are most likely to be installed, i.e., gas-fired power plants or flexible CCS plants, provide flexibility as a by-product. Under the condition of system adequacy, flexibility never poses a challenge in a cost-minimal capacity mix. Therefore, any market design incentivizing investments in efficient generation thus provides flexibility as an inevi complement.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an aggregated approach for the technical and economic assessment of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in congested distribution grids (low voltage and medium voltage). For this purpose, the usage of BESS to avoid or temporally shift grid extensions is analyzed and compared with other technical measures such as grid extensions, innovative grid equipment and feed-in curtailment. A combined optimization approach is used to identify jointly optimal economic decision of grid and storage operators. The investigations highlight the economic competitiveness of BESS, compared to other measures, when additional participation of BESS in wholesale market is allowed. It is shown that optimal decisions for grid development are strongly dependent on key grid parameters like line length and level of excess PV-feed-in. Moreover, the applied regulations, e.g. renewable curtailment rules, are found to impact considerably on the optimal decisions. The proposed methodology is, in contrast to existing approaches, suitable for the investigation of large varieties of grid configurations and grid utilizations with limited efforts. It thus allows identifying situations, in which the application of BESS in distribution grids is most effective. Moreover, it enables a thorough assessment of the impact of regulatory changes given large heterogeneity of existing distribution grids. IEEE},

The innovative aspect of our work is the direct coupling between POLES and EUCAD, thus combining a long-term simulation horizon and a short-term approach for the power system operation.

	abstract = {With the increased variability and uncertainty of net load induced from high penetrations of renewable energy re-sources and more flexible interchange schedules, power systems are facing great operational challenges in maintaining balance. Among these, the scarcity of ramp capability is an important cul-prit of power balance violations and high scarcity prices. To ad-dress this issue, market-based flexible ramping products (FRPs) have been proposed in the industry to improve the availability of ramp capacity. This paper presents an in-depth review of the modeling and implementation of FRPs. The major motivation is that although FRPs are widely discussed in the literature, it is still unclear to many how they can be incorporated into a co-optimization framework that includes energy and ancillary ser-vices. The concept and a definition of power system operational flexibility as well as the needs for FRPs are introduced. The indus-trial practices of implementing FRPs under different market structures are presented. Market operation issues and future re-search topics are also discussed. This paper can provide research-ers and power engineers with further insights into the state of the art, technical barriers, and potential directions for FRPs.},

	abstract = {Utilization of consumers to mitigate the impact of increasing renewable resources on power systems is one of the visions of future smart grids. Flexible consumers are consumers who can change their consumption patterns in such a way as to help the grid to tackle the balancing problem. In previous work, we proposed a hierarchical structure to provide regulating power to the grid by just utilizing the consumption units. The main focus of that work was on designing a centralized controller, a so-called aggregator, which is responsible for aggregating the flexibilities in an optimal way. To accomplish the optimization, the aggregator requires a model which describes the behavior of each consumption unit. These models should be sufficiently simple to be used in the optimization task. However, simple models might not capture all dynamics and features of the real system. In this paper, we will evaluate the proposed setup to understand to what extent the utilization of simplified models can lead to reasonable results. To this end, we will connect the aggregator to a complex and verified model of an actual supermarket refrigeration system which enables us to investigate the closed-loop behavior of the whole set-up.},

	abstract = {The real-time pricing policy can incentivize the electricity users to dynamically change or shift their electricity consumption, thereby improving reliability of the grid. In the smart grid infrastructure, aggregators between the electricity suppliers and users control the users' electricity consumption by dynamically setting electricity price. This work aims at maximizing the overall profit of an aggregator in a billing period by designing a real-time pricing policy. The aggregator pre-announces a pricing policy for an entire billing period, then in each time interval of the billing period, the electricity users (i.e., both residential and EV users) try to maximize their own utility functions based on the pricing model in the current time interval and the awareness of the other users' behaviors. We first formulate a nested two-stage game between the aggregator and the users for each time interval in a billing period, in which the sub game perfect equilibrium can be found. Then, based on backward induction, a dynamic programming algorithm is presented to derive the optimal real-time pricing policy for maximizing the aggregator's overall profit. Different from other works, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is integrated with the aggregator to buffer the mismatch between supply and demand and to improve reliability of the grid. More importantly, this work derives the optimal pricing policy for an aggregator from a global point of view, taking into account the BESS energy state variation in a billing period. Simulation results show that the optimal pricing policy can achieve up to 24.3{\%} improvement on the aggregator's overall profit. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

A study with market data from the Iberian electricity market is used for comparison and validation of the forecasting and optimization performance of the global and divided optimization approaches. The results show that evaluating the forecast quality separately from its impact in the optimization results is misleading, because a forecast with a low error might result in a higher cost than a forecast with higher error. Both bidding approaches were also compared with an inflexible EV load approach where the EV are not controlled by an aggregator and start charging when they plug-in. Results show that optimized bids allow a considerable cost reduction when compared to an inflexible load approach, and the computational performance of the algorithms satisfies the requirements for operational use by a future real EV aggregation agent. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The operator seeks to minimize the smart grid operational cost and offers rewards to aggregators toward this goal. Profit-maximizing aggregators compete to sell DR services to the operator and provide compensation to end- users in order to modify their preferable consumption pattern. Finally, end-users seek to optimize the tradeoff between earnings received from the aggregator and discomfort from having to modify their pattern. Based on this market model, we first address the benchmark scenario from the point of view of a cost-minimizing operator that has full information about user demands. Then, we consider a DR market, where all entities are self-interested and non-cooperative. The proposed market scheme captures the diverse objectives of the involved entities and, compared to flat pricing, guarantees significant benefits for each.

We present two arbitrage approaches: 1) a benchmark that gives us an optimal policy but requires local computation or real-time communication and 2) an alternative based on a thermal energy storage model, which relies on less computation/communication infrastructure, but is suboptimal. We find that the alternative approach achieves around 60{\%}–80{\%} of the optimal wholesale energy cost savings. We use this approach to compute practical upper bounds for savings via arbitrage with air conditioners in California's intraday energy market. We investigate six sites over four years and find that the savings range from {\$}2–{\$}37 per TCL per year, and depend upon outdoor temperature statistics and price volatility.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper, a new model is developed to optimise the performance of a plug-in Electric Vehicle (EV) aggregator in electricity markets, considering both short- and long-term horizons. EV aggregator as a new player of the power market can aggregate the EVs and manage the charge/discharge of their batteries. The aggregator maximises the profit and optimises EV owners' revenue by applying changes in tariffs to compete with other market players for retaining current customers and acquiring new owners. On this basis, a new approach to calculate the satisfaction/motivation of EV owners and their market participation is proposed in this paper. Moreover, the behaviour of owners to select their supplying company is considered. The aggregator optimises the self-scheduling programme and submits the best bidding/offering strategies to the day-ahead and real-time markets. To achieve this purpose, the day-ahead and real-time energy and reserve markets are modelled as oligopoly markets, in contrast with previous works that utilised perfectly competitive ones. Furthermore, several uncertainties and constraints are taken into account using a two-stage stochastic programing approach, which have not been addressed in previous works. The numerical studies show the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Key sources of uncertainty affecting the modeling results are identified and are characterized via multiple stochastic scenarios. We then pro- pose a risk-averse optimal bidding formulation for the resource aggregator at the demand side based on the conditional value-at- risk (VaR) theory. Specifically, this strategy seeks to minimize the expected regret value over a subset of worst-case scenarios whose collective probability is no more than a threshold value. Our approach ensures the robustness of the day-ahead (DA) bidding strategy while considering the uncertainties associated with the renewable generation, real-time price, and electricity demand. We carry out numerical simulations against three benchmark bidding strategies, including a VaR-based approach and a tradi- tional scenario based stochastic programming approach. We find that the proposed strategy outperforms the benchmark strategies in terms of hedging high regret risks, and results in computa- tional efficiency and DA bidding costs that are comparable to the benchmarks.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the optimal planning and operation of aggregated distributed energy resources (DER) with participation in the electricity market. Aggregators manage their portfolio of resources in order to obtain the maximum benefit from the grid, while participating in the day-ahead wholesale electricity market. The goal of this paper is to propose a model for aggregated DER systems planning, considering its participation in the electricity market and its impact on the market price. The results are the optimal planning and management of DER systems, and the appropriate energy transactions for the aggregator in the wholesale day-ahead market according to the size of its aggregated resources. A price-maker approach based on representing the market competitors with residual demand curves is followed, and the impact on the price is assessed to help in the decision of using price-maker or price-taker approaches depending on the size of the aggregated resources. A deterministic programming problem with two case studies (the average scenario and the most likely scenario from the stochastic ones), and a stochastic one with a case study to account for the market uncertainty are described. For both models, market scenarios have been built from historical data of the Spanish system. The results suggest that when the aggregated resources have enough size to follow a price-maker approach and the uncertainty of the markets is considered in the planning process, the DER systems can achieve up to 50{\%} extra economic benefits, depending on the market share, compared with a non-aggregated business-as-usual approach (not implementing DER systems).},

Further, the proposed model considers the customers' behaviour in participating in the given DR program through a scenario-based participation factor. On the other hand, the upper level proposes trading the DR outcome in day-ahead and balancing markets with uncertain prices, as well as in forward contracts with a predefined price. The overall bottom-up problem is formulated as a stochastic profit maximization model for the DR aggregator, in which the risk is taken into account using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measure.

In fact, an increasing penetration of DERs in Low Voltage (LV) grids likely pushes the system to congestion conditions more easily but also adds additional flexibility potential to the power system. Currently, the demand response solutions implemented in a significant number of countries do not consider aggregation of customers/prosumers at LV level but typically focus on fewer resources of greater individual size (i.e. industrial loads) connected to Medium and High Voltage levels. Hence the system requires a new actor to manage the resources connected at LV level in the most efficient way.The paper describes the implementation of a real-time Commercial Aggregator, that pools the generation and/or consumption flexibility offered by its customers to provide energy and services to actors within the system.

	abstract = {In recent years, extensive researches have been conducted on implementation of demand response programs (DRPs), aimed to electricity price reduction, transmission lines congestion resolving, security enhancement and improvement of market liquidity. Basically, DRPs are divided into two main categories namely, incentive-based programs (IBPs) and time-based rate programs (TBRPs). Mathematical modeling of these programs helps regulators and market policy makers to evaluate the impact of price responsive loads on the market and system operational conditions. In this paper, an economic model of price/incentive responsive loads is derived based on the concept of flexible price elasticity of demand and customer benefit function. The mathematical model for flexible price elasticity of demand is presented to calculate each of the demand response (DR) program's elasticity based on the electricity price before and after implementing DRPs. In the proposed model, a demand ratio parameter has been introduced to determine the appropriate values of incentive and penalty in IBPs according to the level of demand. Furthermore, the importance of determining optimum participation level of customers in different DRPs has been investigated. The proposed model together with the strategy success index (SSI) has been applied to provide an opportunity for major players of the market, i.e. independent system operator (ISO), utilities and customers to select their favorite programs that satisfy their desires. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, numerical studies are conducted on the Iranian interconnected network load profile on the annual peak day of the year 2007. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a weighted combination of different demand vs. price functions referred to as Composite Demand Function (CDF) is introduced in order to represent the demand model of consuming sectors which comprise different clusters of customers with divergent load profiles and energy use habitudes. Derived from the mathematical representations of demand, dynamic price elasticities are proposed to demonstrate the customers' demand sensitivity with respect to the hourly price. Based on the proposed CDF and dynamic elasticities, a comprehensive demand response (CDR) model is developed in this paper for the purpose of representing customer response to time-based and incentive-based demand response (DR) programs. The above model helps a Retail Energy Provider (REP) agent in an agent-based retail environment to offer day-ahead real time prices to its customers. The most beneficial real time prices are determined through an economically optimized manner represented by REP agent's learning capability based on the principles of Q-learning method incorporating different aspects of the problem such as price caps and customer response to real time pricing as a time-based demand response program represented by the CDR model. Numerical studies are conducted based on New England day-ahead market's data to investigate the performance of the proposed model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Energy storage devices, such as batteries, have been proposed as a solution to the need for additional power systems services caused by variability and uncertainty in system demand and renewable energy production. However, in many respects, buildings and appliances with thermal mass are equivalent or even superior to batteries for these purposes. In this paper, we examine the potential for residential thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), such as air conditioners, electric water heaters, and refrigerators, to deliver power systems services and participate in short timescale energy markets. These loads operate within a hysteretic ON/OFF dead-band and therefore act much like energy storage devices, modulating power use around their baseline consumptions. Carefully designed demand response (DR) schemes allow us to both control aggregations of TCLs to track market or automatic generation control signals and ensure that they provide the service requested by the consumer. This paper estimates the size of the potential resource; potential revenue from participation in markets; and break-even costs associated with deploying DR-enabling technologies. We find that current residential TCL energy storage capacity in California is 8–11 GWh, with refrigerators contributing the most. Annual revenues from participation in regulation vary from {\$}10 to {\$}220 per appliance per year depending upon the type of appliance and climate zone, while load following and arbitrage revenues are more modest. We conclude with a number of policy recommendations including the design of new markets and communications/appliance standards that will make it easier to engage residential loads in fast timescale DR.},

	abstract = {Demand response (DR) is very important in the future smart grid, aiming to encourage consumers to reduce their demand during peak load hours. However, if binary decision variables are needed to specify start-up time of a particular appliance, the resulting mixed integer combinatorial problem is in general difficult to solve. In this paper, we study a versatile convex programming (CP) DR optimization framework for the automatic load management of various household appliances in a smart home. In particular, an L1 regularization technique is proposed to deal with schedule-based appliances (SAs), for which their on/off statuses are governed by binary decision variables. By relaxing these variables from integer to continuous values, the problem is reformulated as a new CP problem with an additional L1 regularization term in the objective. This allows us to transform the original mixed integer problem into a standard CP problem. Its major advantage is that the overall DR optimization problem remains to be convex and therefore the solution can be found efficiently. Moreover, a wide variety of appliances with different characteristics can be flexibly incorporated. Simulation result shows that the energy scheduling of SAs and other appliances can be determined simultaneously using the proposed CP formulation. {\textcopyright} 2010-2012 IEEE.},

The proposed real-time price-based DR management application can be imbedded into smart meters and automatically executed on-line for determining the optimal operation of residential appliances within 5-minute time slots while considering uncertainties in real-time electricity prices. Operation tasks of residential appliances are categorized into deferrable/non-deferrable and interruptible/non-interruptible ones based on appliances' DR preferences as well as their distinct spatial and temporal operation characteristics. The stochastic optimization adopts the scenario-based approach via Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for minimizing the expected electricity payment for the entire day, while controlling the financial risks associated with real-time electricity price uncertainties via the expected downside risks formulation. Price uncertainty intervals are considered in the robust optimization for minimizing the worst-case electricity payment while flexibly adjusting the solution robustness. Both approaches are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems and solved by state-of-the-art MILP solvers. The numerical results show attributes of the two approaches for solving the real-time optimal DR management problem for residential appliances.},

	abstract = {The high penetration of both Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and Demand Response (DR) in modern power systems requires a sequence of advanced strategies and technologies for maintaining system reliability and flexibility. Real-time electricity markets (RTM) are the non-discriminatory transaction platforms for providing necessary balancing services, where the market clearing (nodal or zonal prices depending on markets) is very close to real time operations of power systems. One of the primary functions of RTMs in modern power systems is establishing an efficient and effective mechanism for small DER and DR to participate in balancing market transactions, while handling their meteorological or intermittent characteristics, facilitating asset utilization, and stimulating their active responses. Consequently, RTMs are dedicated to maintaining the flexibility and reliability of power systems. This paper reviews advanced typical RTMs respectively in the North America, Australia and Europe, focusing on their market architectures and incentive policies for integrating DER and DR in electricity markets. In this paper, RTMs are classified into three groups: Group I applies nodal prices implemented by optimal power flow, which clears energy prices every 5. min. Group II applies zonal prices, with the time resolution of 5-min. Group III is a general balancing market, which clears zonal prices intro-hourly. The various successful advanced RTM experiences have been summarized and discussed, which provides a technical overview of the present RTMs integrating DER and DR.},

This work draws on the existing collaboration between the EC and the US Department of Energy (DoE) in the framework of the EU-US Energy Council. The assessment framework is structured into a set of guidelines to tailor assumptions to local conditions, to identify and monetize benefits and costs, and to perform sensitivity analysis of most critical variables. It also provides guidance in the identification of externalities and social impacts that can result from the implementation of smart metering deployment but that cannot be easily monetized and factored into the cost benefit computation. This study represents the application to the specific case of smart metering deployment of the general guidelines for conducting a cost benefit analysis of Smart Grid projects [EC 2012b].},

The increasing deployment of non-dispatchable generation in electric systems where generation and demand must be balanced at all times has led to a renewed interest in technologies for energy storage. This study presents a cost-benefit analysis of energy storage for peak demand reduction in medium-voltage distribution networks. In particular, the installation of batteries in secondary substations is studied for three realistic large-scale networks representing urban, semi-urban and rural distribution areas. On the one hand, savings in energy costs derived from storing energy at low-priced hours and selling it at peak hours are considered. On the other hand, savings in network reinforcement due to the peak shaving are evaluated. Network reinforcement requirements are assessed using reference network models, large-scale network-planning tools often used by distribution regulators to establish the allowed distribution costs. Additionally, sensitivity to different demand growth ratios and battery capacities is analysed. The final objective is to determine the target cost for batteries to be profitable from the point of view of distribution. Results show that significant savings can be obtained, especially in urban and semi-urban areas.},

However, in the light of rising retail electricity prices and falling costs for rooftop solar installations in recent years, policy makers and regulators face the difficult task of deciding when and how these schemes should be amended or phased out. To understand how such actions might shape the role of residential solar and the resulting economics in a changing electricity system, we study how the design of FiR schemes affects optimal PV system sizes. To illustrate our approach, we draw on empirical data on the FiR policies of Net Metering and Feed-in Tariffs from California and Germany between 2005 and 2016. Using a techno-economic model and a conceptual framework, we show that FiR design and its interplay with retail electricity prices and PV system costs jointly determine whether residential PV installations are economic, how they are sized, and which prosumer paradigms they spur. Our analysis holds numerous implications for policy makers and advisors responsible for redesigning or adapting existing FiR mechanisms, as well as for the stakeholders of an emerging ecosystem based on residential solar PV.},

The paper at hand investigates the installation of grid-supporting battery storage system (BSS) in the medium voltage (MV) level to serve mainly for voltage compliance and to defer grid reinforcement. A control approach for the BSS based on two characteristic curves is suggested. The BSS is then analyzed technically and economically for scenarios of high distributed generation. The results show that the alternative of BSS has potential to defer grid reinforcement in the presented case studies. However, the power curtailment is more viable than the BSS and grid reinforcement. The economic viability of BSS can increase in the future based on the expected reduction of battery costs. Furthermore, BSS have the technical potential for providing other services, since voltage violations occur during high feed-in times.},

This perspective suggests that the design hierarchy of a product can have an ordering effect on the evolution of commercialized artifacts, in particular when product design decisions on high levels of the design hierarchy set the agenda for subsequent variation and experimentation on lower levels. We extend this literature by analyzing the design hierarchy's effect on the evolution of the industry's knowledge base, using the case of wind turbine technology over the period 1973-2009. We assess the technological focus of patents along the core trajectory of knowledge generation, identified through a patent-citation network analysis, and link it to a classification of technological problems into different levels in the design hierarchy. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of an industry's knowledge base along a technological trajectory is not a unidirectional process of gradual refinement: the focus of knowledge generation shifts over time between different sub-systems in a highly sequential pattern, whose order is strongly influenced by the design hierarchy. Each of these shifts initiates the integration of new domains of industry-external knowledge into the knowledge base, thus opening windows of competitive opportunity for potential entrants with strong knowledge positions in the new focus of inventive activity. We discuss implications for the understanding of the competitive advantage of specific knowledge positions of firms and nations and technology policy for emerging technologies.},

	abstract = {We examine the changes to the electric power system required to incorporate high penetration of variable wind and solar electricity generation in a transmission constrained grid. Simulations were performed in the Texas, US (ERCOT) grid where different mixes of wind, solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power meet up to 80{\%} of the electric demand. The primary constraints on incorporation of these sources at large scale are the limited time coincidence of the resource with normal electricity demand, combined with the limited flexibility of thermal generators to reduce output. An additional constraint in the ERCOT system is the current inability to exchange power with neighboring grids.By themselves, these constraints would result in unusable renewable generation and increased costs. But a highly flexible system - with must-run baseload generators virtually eliminated - allows for penetrations of up to about 50{\%} variable generation with curtailment rates of less than 10{\%}. For penetration levels up to 80{\%} of the system's electricity demand, keeping curtailments to less than 10{\%} requires a combination of load shifting and storage equal to about one day of average demand. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {While support instruments have succeeded to largely deploy renewables during the 1996-2008 period, little attention has been paid to energy efficiency measures, resulting in a high energy intensity and large growth of energy demand. Energy-related CO 2 emissions have increased significantly. At the same time, important investments in combined cycle gas turbines have taken place. This paper analyses whether, from a cost minimization viewpoint, renewable support has been the best policy for reducing emissions, when compared to the promotion of energy efficiency in sectors such as transportation or buildings. We use a model of the Spanish energy sector to examine its evolution in the time period considered under different policies. It is a bottom-up, static, partial equilibrium, linear programming model of the complete Spanish energy system. We conclude that demand side management (DSM) clearly dominates renewable energy (RE) support if the reduction of emissions at minimum cost is the only concern. We also quantify the savings that could have been achieved: a total of €5 billion per year, mainly in RE subsidies and in smaller costs of meeting the reduced demand (net of DSM implementation cost). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In order to meet greenhouse gas emissions targets the Great Britain (GB) future electricity supply will include a higher fraction of non-dispatchable generation, increasing opportunities for demand side management to maintain a supply/demand balance. This paper examines the extent of flexible domestic demand (FDD) in GB, its usefulness in system balancing and appropriate incentives to encourage consumers to participate. FDD, classified as electric space and water heating (ESWH), and cold and wet appliances, amounts to 59. TW. h in 2012 (113. TW. h total domestic demand) and is calculated to increase to 67. TW. h in 2030. Summer and winter daily load profiles for flexible loads show significant seasonal and diurnal variations in the total flexible load and between load categories. Low levels of reflective consumer engagement with electricity consumption and a resistance to automation present barriers to effective access to FDD. A value of {\pounds}1.97/household/year has been calculated for cold appliance loads used for frequency response in 2030, using 2013 market rates. The introduction of smart meters in GB by 2020 will allow access to FDD for system balancing. The low commercial value of individual domestic loads increases the attractiveness of non-financial incentives to fully exploit FDD. It was shown that appliance loads have different characteristics which can contribute to an efficient power system in different ways.},

	abstract = {The aim of this article is to assess the potential of flexible demand in a far future energy system. Flexible energy systems are imperative for more integration of fluctuating renewable energy sources (RES) and therefore flexible demand as a flexible measure becomes more significant. Denmark is a leading country for high share of wind power in its electricity production and has announced to become a non-fossil fuel using country by 2050. In this article, Denmark is seen as a case due to this ambitious national goal, but the validity of the object of the analyses is not restricted to Denmark. The energy system simulated in this article is based on a Danish government year 2050 scenario based solely on RES. The article adopts two approaches for the assessment of the potential of flexible demand. The first approach is a bottom-up technical approach investigating the potential of flexible demand from individual processes. Secondly, the level of flexible demand which makes a significant impact on the future energy system is assessed with a view to investigating whether the two approaches will ever meet and thus whether flexible demand has a significant role to play in the future energy system. The results show that the potential of flexible demand is only found in the 2. h time frame with 24{\%} and the daily time frame with approx. 7{\%} of the electricity demand. The system benefit at the assessed amount of flexible demand is limited however. Results from the other analysis indicate that in order to have a significant impact on the energy system performance, more than a quarter of the classic electricity demand would need to be flexible within a month, which is highly unlikely to happen. The value of flexible demand in the energy system is thus limited. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The paper reviews different approaches, technologies, and strategies to manage large-scale schemes of variable renewable electricity such as solar and wind power. We consider both supply and demand side measures. In addition to presenting energy system flexibility measures, their importance to renewable electricity is discussed. The flexibility measures available range from traditional ones such as grid extension or pumped hydro storage to more advanced strategies such as demand side management and demand side linked approaches, e.g. the use of electric vehicles for storing excess electricity, but also providing grid support services. Advanced batteries may offer new solutions in the future, though the high costs associated with batteries may restrict their use to smaller scale applications. Different "P2Y"-type of strategies, where P stands for surplus renewable power and Y for the energy form or energy service to which this excess in converted to, e.g. thermal energy, hydrogen, gas or mobility are receiving much attention as potential flexibility solutions, making use of the energy system as a whole. To "functionalize" or to assess the value of the various energy system flexibility measures, these need often be put into an electricity/energy market or utility service context. Summarizing, the outlook for managing large amounts of RE power in terms of options available seems to be promising.},

	abstract = {Relying almost entirely on energy from variable renewable resources such as wind and solar energy will require a transformation in the way power systems are planned and operated. This paper outlines the necessary steps in creating power systems with the flexibility needed to maintain stability and reliability while relying primarily on variable energy resources. These steps are provided in the form of a comprehensive overview of policies, technical changes, and institutional systems, organized in three development phases: an initial phase (penetration up to about 10{\%}) characterized by relatively mild changes to conventional power system operations and structures; a dynamic middle phase (up to about 50{\%} penetration) characterized by phasing out conventional generation and a concerted effort to wring flexibility from existing infrastructure; and the high penetration phase that inevitably addresses how power systems operate over longer periods of weeks or months when variable generation will be in either short supply, or in over-abundance. Although this transition is likely a decades-long and incremental process and depends on the specifics of each system, the needed policies, research, demonstration projects and institutional changes need to start now precisely because of the complexity of the transformation. The list of policy actions presented in this paper can serve as a guideline to policy makers on effectuating the transition and on tracking the preparedness of systems.},

In general, the instant balance of temporal and spatial inequalities of the electricity system can be achieved by many compensating measures. However, a thorough and precise quantification of the flexibility demand of a VRE based energy system turns out to be a complex task. So far, literature on energy economics and engineering has provided analyses concerning various aspects of the system requirements for flexibility. Accordingly, this review paper primarily aims to categorize the scientific approaches that have been used in "flexibility demand" studies. In this context, we classify exemplary study results from the German and European energy systems into technical, economic, and market potential categories to enhance their comparability. Moreover, we conduct a methodological evaluation of the literature findings to determine further research requirements. Against this background we also discuss a conceptual framework to quantify the market potential of flexible technologies.},

Through various Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring techniques, consumer behavior may be inferred from their metering data. In this paper, we propose an energy management method that reduces energy cost and protects privacy through the minimization of information leakage. The method is based on a Model Predictive Controller that utilizes energy storage and local generation, and that predicts the effects of its actions on the statistics of the actual energy consumption of a consumer and that seen by the grid. Computationally, the method requires solving a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program of manageable size whenever new meter readings are available. We simulate the controller on generated residential load profiles with different privacy costs in a two-tier time-of-use energy pricing environment. Results show that information leakage is effectively reduced at the expense of increased energy cost. The results also show that with the proposed controller the consumer load profile seen by the grid resembles a mixture between that obtained with Non-Intrusive Load Leveling and Lazy Stepping.},

In particular, consumer behaviour and lifestyle choices may be inferred from their metering data using various Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring tech-niques. To protect consumer privacy, energy storage controlled by a Model-Distribution Predictive Control scheme can be utilised to mask the actual energy consumption by measuring privacy loss through the mutual information between actual and grid-visible energy consumption. However, the poor scalability of this approach limits the size of the prediction horizon, which is important for both energy cost and privacy loss reduction. In this paper, we propose using time aggregation to increase the reach of the controller's prediction horizon, and describe how to correctly model the statistics in this setting. Results show that with the proposed time aggregation, information leakage and energy costs can be further reduced without increasing the controller's computational requirements.},

	abstract = {This article focuses on the design of balancing markets in Europe taking into account an increasing wind power penetration. In several European countries, wind generation is so far not burdened with full balancing responsibility. However, the more wind power penetration, the less bearable for the system not to allocate balancing costs to the responsible parties. Given the variability and limited predictability of wind generation, full balancing exposure is however only feasible conditionally to well-functioning balancing markets. On that account, recommendations ensuring an optimal balancing market design are formulated and their impact on wind generation is assessed. Taking market-based or cost-reflective imbalance prices as the main objective, it is advised that: (1) the imbalance settlement should not contain penalties or power exchange prices, (2) capacity payments should be allocated to imbalanced BRPs via an additive component in the imbalance price and (3) a cap should be imposed on the amount of reserves. Efficient implementation of the proposed market design may require balancing markets being integrated across borders. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Then some key features of the short-term adjustments required by wind energy are discussed and the necessity of sufficient liquidity in intraday markets is highlighted. For the example of the German market subsequently the discrepancy between the physical short-term adjustment needs and the traded volumes on the intraday market is analyzed.

	abstract = {Australia has been an early and enthusiastic adopter of both electricity industry restructuring and market-based environmental regulation. The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) was established in 1999 and Australia also implemented one of the world's first renewable energy target schemes in 2001. With significant recent growth in wind generation, Australia provides an interesting case for assessing different approaches to facilitating wind integration into the electricity industry. Wind project developers in Australia must assess both potential energy market and Tradeable Green Certificate income streams when making investments. Wind-farm energy income depends on the match of its uncertain time varying output with the regional half hourly market price; a price that exhibits daily, weekly and seasonal patterns and considerable uncertainty. Such price signals assist in driving investments that maximize project value to the electricity industry as a whole, including integration costs and benefits for other participants. Recent NEM rule changes will formally integrate wind generation in the market's scheduling processes while a centralized wind forecasting system has also been introduced. This paper outlines experience to date with wind integration in the NEM, describes the evolution of market rules in response and assesses their possible implications for facilitating high future wind penetrations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although several alternatives combining support schemes and market signals could improve the current situation in terms of market signals and risks, feed-in premium support scheme seems actually to be the more balanced option.

	abstract = {Competitive electricity markets are being challenged by the need to decarbonise electricity production. The Paris Agreement reached at the UNFCCC COP21 conference in December 2015 is expected to give new strength to policies on climate change and the low-carbon energy transition. But the challenge is daunting: according to International Energy Agency (IEA) projections for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies, the average CO2 intensity of electricity needs to fall from 411 grams per kilowatt hour (g/kWh) in 2015 to 15 g/kWh by 2050 to achieve the goal of limiting the global increase in temperatures to 2°C. While many studies conclude that this is both technically and economically feasible, reaching this goal calls for new power market designs. Page | 11 This book examines how the design of electricity markets enables the transition to a low- carbon electricity system, at least cost, while maintaining electricity security. Debates on market design for a low-carbon power system generally present two contrasting policy options: reliance on either wholesale electricity markets with a strong carbon price, or technology-specific policies and regulations. But failures can be observed both in markets and policies. It is increasingly clear that a binary opposition is no longer sufficient to define the market framework.},

Daily spot prices from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2004 are employed. The results show that the regime-switching model outperforms the basic stochastic and mean-reverting models. Electricity prices are also found to exhibit stronger mean-reversion after a price spike than in the normal period, and price volatility is more than fourteen times higher in spike periods than in normal periods.

This paper empirically analyses an additional albeit usually neglected benefit: the reduction in the wholesale price of electricity as a result of more RES-E generation being fed into the grid. The case of wind generation in Spain shows that this reduction is greater than the increase in the costs for the consumers arising from the RES-E support scheme (the feed-in tariffs), which are charged to the final consumer. Therefore, a net reduction in the retail electricity price results, which is positive from a consumer point of view. This provides an additional argument for RES-E support and contradicts one of the usual arguments against RES-E deployment: the excessive burden on the consumer. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These policies have a non-negligible cost, and therefore a careful assessment of their impacts seems necessary. In particular, one of the most-debated impacts is their effect on electricity prices, for which there have been some ex-ante studies, but few ex-post studies. This article presents a full ex-post empirical analysis, by looking at use of technologies and hourly electricity prices for 2005-2009 in Spain, to study the effects that the introduction of renewable electricity and cogeneration has had on wholesale electricity prices. It is particularly interesting to perform this study in Spain where an active system of public support to renewables and cogeneration has led to a considerable expansion of these energy sources and electricity pricing is at the center of intense debate. The paper reports that a marginal increase of 1. GWh of electricity production using renewables and cogeneration is associated with a reduction of almost 2 € per MWh in electricity prices (around 4{\%} of the average price for the analyzed period). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

SA's wind energy penetration has recently surpassed 20{\%} and it has only a limited interconnection with other regions of the NEM. As such, it represents an interesting example of high wind penetration in a gross wholesale pool market electricity industry. Our findings suggest that while electricity demand continues to have the greatest influence on spot prices in SA, wind generation levels have become a significant secondary influence, and there is an inverse relationship between wind generation and price. No clear relationship between wind generation and demand has been identified although some periods of extremely high demand may coincide with lower wind generation. Periods of high wind output are associated with generally lower market prices, and also appear to contribute to extreme negative price events. The results highlight the importance of electricity market and renewable policy design in facilitating economically efficient high wind penetrations. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although the merit-order effect is only one of several consequences of renewable production on the electricity system, it is crucial to determine its size for the economic evaluation of renewable energies. In this paper we present a comprehensive overview of relevant past research results on the price effect of renewables. Additionally, we conduct a new empirical analysis of the price effect of renewable production for the Austrian-German region, a market that clearly qualifies for a merit-order effect analysis given its characteristics. Based on the review and our own analysis, we show that the merit-order effect varies depending on the region and the assessment method chosen. We also find that the size of this effect is less dispersed throughout different markets than previously suggested by the literature. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We do so from three interrelated perspectives that a meaningful public policy framework for inquiry must take into account. First, we explore different social objectives justifying the deployment of RE technologies and review model-based estimates of the economic potential of RE technologies, i.e. their socially optimal deployment level. Second, we address pivotal market failures that arise in the course of implementing the economic potential of RE sources in decentralized markets. Third, we discuss multiple policy instruments curing these market failures. Our framework reveals the requirements for an assessment of the relevant options for real-world decision makers in the field of RE policies.

	abstract = {In electricity markets that use a merit order dispatch system, generation capacity is ranked by the price that it is bid into the market. Demand is then met by dispatching electricity according to this rank, from the lowest to the highest bid. The last capacity dispatched sets the price received by all generation, ensuring the lowest cost provision of electricity. A consequence of this system is that significant deployments of low marginal cost electricity generators, including renewables, can reduce the spot price of electricity. In Australia, this prospect has been recognized in concern expressed by some coal-fired generators that delivering too much renewable generation would reduce wholesale electricity prices. In this analysis we calculate the likely reduction of wholesale prices through this merit order effect on the Australian National Electricity Market. We calculate that for 5. GW of capacity, comparable to the present per capita installation of photovoltaics in Germany, the reduction in wholesale prices would have been worth in excess of A{\$}1.8 billion over 2009 and 2010, all other factors being equal.

The results show that the SEG has caused a 7{\%} reduction in average electricity prices for this period. The average daily maximum price and daily price variation are also found to decrease, by 13{\%} and 23{\%}, respectively. When taking the MOE into account the net consumer's cost of the solar feed-in tariff (FIT) system is found to be 23{\%} less than the charge listed in the electricity bill.

	abstract = {Growing climate change and energy security concerns are driving major wind energy deployment in electricity industries around the world. Despite its many advantages, growing penetrations of this highly variable and somewhat unpredictable energy source pose new challenges for electricity industry operation. One issue receiving growing attention is the so-called 'merit order effect' of wind generation in wholesale electricity markets. Wind has very low operating costs and therefore tends to displace higher cost conventional generation from market dispatch, reducing both wholesale prices and conventional plant outputs. This paper extends the current literature on this effect through an empirical study employing a range of econometric techniques to quantify the impacts of growing wind penetrations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The results suggest that wind is having a marked impact on spot market prices and, while wind is primarily offsetting higher operating cost gas generation, it is now also significantly reducing dispatch of emissions intensive brown coal generation. Great care needs to be taken in extrapolating these results to longer-term implications, however, the study does propose a methodology for assessing this effect, highlights the impacts that wind is already having on NEM outcomes and suggests promising directions for future research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Mainly responsible for this development is the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz, EEG). This paper considers redistributive implications of the EEG for different electricity consumers. Using time-series regression analysis, we show that electricity generation by wind and PV has reduced spot market prices considerably by 6. €/MWh in 2010 rising to 10. €/MWh in 2012. We use these results to build a near-term forecasting tool for merit order effects, projected to reach 14-16. €/MWh in 2016. On the other hand, the costs of the EEG are passed forward to consumers in the form of a surcharge. Our findings highlight significant redistributive transfers under the current design of the EEG. In particular, some energy-intensive industries are benefiting from lower wholesale electricity prices whilst being largely exempted from contributing to the costs of the scheme. We also highlight implications of our results for other areas for reform of the EEG, such as adequate renumeration mechanisms that ensure efficient operation and investment decisions are made under the scheme. More generally, these findings suggest that policy makers need to integrate distributional assessments into policy design and implementation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

In the frame of a dynamic fundamental model, we show that there has been a continuous electricity price adaption process to market fundamentals. Furthermore, the fundamental drivers of prices differ among hours with different load profiles. Our results imply that renewable energies decrease market spot prices and have implications on the traditional fuel mix for electricity production. However, the prices for the final consumers increased overall because they must pay in addition the feed-in tariffs for the promotion of renewable energy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Hence, this paper introduces an econometric model for the hourly time series of electricity prices of the European Power Exchange (EPEX) which incorporates specific features like renewable energy. The model consists of several sophisticated and established approaches and can be regarded as a periodic VAR-TARCH with wind power, solar power, and load as influences on the time series. It is able to map the distinct and well-known features of electricity prices in Germany. An efficient iteratively reweighted lasso approach is used for the estimation.

We analyze the Italian day-ahead wholesale electricity market, finding empirical evidence of the merit-order effect. Over the period 2005-2013 an increase of 1. GWh in the hourly average of daily production from solar and wind sources has, on average, reduced wholesale electricity prices by respectively 2.3???/MWh and 4.2???/MWh and has amplified their volatility. The impact on prices has decreased over time in correspondence with the increase in solar and wind electricity production. We estimate that, over the period 2009-2013, solar production has generated higher monetary savings than wind production, mainly because the former is more prominent than the latter. However, in the solar case, monetary savings are not sufficient to compensate the cost of the related supporting schemes which are entirely internalized within end-user tariffs, causing a reduction of the consumer surplus, while the opposite occurs in the case of wind.},

The first question is timely and relevant because if the merit-order effect estimates are small, California's renewable energy development is of limited help in cutting electricity consumers' bills but also has a lesser adverse impact on the state's investment incentive for natural-gas-fired generation. The second question is related to the efficient market hypothesis under which the hourly RTM and DAM prices tend to converge. Using a sample of about 21,000 hourly observations of CAISO market prices and their fundamental drivers during 12/12/2012-04/30/2015, we document statistically significant estimates (p-value≤0.01) for the DAM and RTM merit-order effects. This finding lends support to California's adopted procurement process to provide sufficient investment incentives for natural-gas-fired generation. We document that the RTM-DAM price divergence partly depends on the CASIO's day-ahead forecast errors for system loads and renewable energy. This finding suggests that improving the performance of the CAISO's day-ahead forecasts can enhance trading efficiency in California's DAM and RTM electricity markets.},

I draw on policy-relevant scenarios for Germany and make use of extensive sensitivity analyses. Whereas yearly renewable surplus energy is low in most scenarios analyzed, peak surplus power can become very high. Decreasing thermal must-run requirements and increasing biomass flexibility substantially reduce surpluses. I use an optimization model to determine the storage capacities required for taking up renewable surpluses. Allowing curtailment of 1{\%} of the yearly feed-in of non-dispatchable renewables would render storage investments largely obsolete until 2032 under the assumption of a flexible power system. Further restrictions of curtailment as well as lower system flexibility strongly increase storage requirements. By 2050, at least 10. GW of storage are required for surplus integration, of which a sizeable share is seasonal storage. Results suggest that policy makers should work toward avoiding surplus generation, in particular by decreasing the must-run of thermal generators. Concerns about surpluses should not be regarded as an obstacle to further renewable expansion. The findings are also relevant for other countries that shift toward fluctuating renewables. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new method for incorporating short-term temporal variability of both power demand and VRE (variable renewables) into long-term energy-economy models: the RLDC approach. The core of the implementation is a representation of RLDCs (residual load duration curves), which change endogenously depending on the share and mix of VRE. The approach captures major VRE integration challenges and the energy system's response to growing VRE shares without a considerable increase of numerical complexity. The approach also allows for an endogenous representation of power-to-gas storage and the simultaneous optimization of long-term investment and short-term dispatch decisions of non-VRE plants. As an example, we apply the RLDC approach to REMIND-D, a long-term energy-economy model of Germany, which was based on the global model REMIND-R 1.2. Representing variability results in significantly more non-VRE capacity and reduces the generation of VRE in 2050 by about one-third in baseline and ambitious mitigation scenarios. Explicit modeling of variability increases mitigation costs by about one fifth, but power-to-gas storage can alleviate this increase by one third. Implementing the RLDC approach in a long-term energy-economy model would allow improving the robustness and credibility of scenarios results, such as mitigation costs estimates and the role of VRE.},

Benefits from deferral of system upgrades may be important in the decision to deploy EES.

For a 16 kWh (57.6 MJ) vehicle battery pack, the maximum annual profit with perfect market information and no battery degradation cost ranged from ???US{\$}140 to {\$}250 in the three cities.

	abstract = {Demand response (DR) is one of many approaches to address temporal mismatches in demand and supply of grid electricity. More common in the commercial sector, DR usually refers to reducing consumption at certain hours or seasons, thus reducing peak demand from the grid. In the residential sector, where sophisticated appliance-level controls such as automatic dimming of lights or on-demand lowering of air conditioning are less common, building-based electricity storage to shift grid consumption from peak to off-peak times could provide DR without requiring consumers to operate their appliances on shifted or reduced schedules: Storage would be dispatched to appliances as needed while still shaving peaks on the grid. Technologically, storage and two-way-inverters are readily available to enable such residential DR. Economically, however, the situation is less clear. Specifically, are time-varying electricity tariffs available such that electricity cost reduction via arbitrage could offset manufacturing, financing, and installation costs of the required storage? To address this question we (i) devise an agent-based appliance-level stochastic model to simulate the electricity demand of an average U.S. household; (ii) loadshift the demand via simple dispatch strategies; and (iii) determine potential profits to the building owner, i.e. reduced electricity cost of the modified demand with realistic tariffs (Con Edison, NY) minus storage cost. We determine the economic viability for a range of traditional and advanced storage technologies as well as their optimum storage capacities to maximize profits. We find that (i) profits can range from {\textless}1{\%} to 48{\%} of annual electricity costs of a typical household; and (ii) optimum capacities, while approximately equal to households' kWh consumption during peak hours, is affected by stochastic variations in daily and seasonal consumption. Future improvements to storage technology, arbitrage strategies, and tariffs are discussed.

Any reductions in capital costs needed to achieve an IRR of 10{\%} are solved for. Results show that the profit-maximizing size (i.e. hours of energy storage) of an ESS is primarily determined by its technological characteristics (round-trip charge/discharge efficiency and self-discharge) and not market price volatility, which instead increases IRR.

	abstract = {Price volatility and increasing renewable energy generation have raised interest in the potential opportunities for storage technologies in energy-only electricity markets. In this paper we explore the value of a price-taking storage device in such a market, the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia. Our analysis suggests that under optimal operation, there is little value in having more than six hours of storage in this market. However, an inability to perfectly forecast wholesale prices, particularly extreme price spikes, may warrant some additional storage. We found that storage devices effectively provide a similar service to peak generators and are similarly dependent on and exposed to extreme price events, with revenue for a merchant generator highly skewed to a few days of the year. As a consequence of this finding, and in contrast to previous studies, the value of storage was found to be relatively insensitive to the round trip efficiency. We also found that the variability of revenue and exposure to extreme prices could be reduced using common hedging strategies, such as those currently used by peak generators. We present a case study that demonstrates storage technologies using such strategies may have a competitive advantage over other peaking generators in the NEM, due to the ability to earn revenue outside of extreme peak events. Similar to traditional peak generators, a main driver for storage options in an energy-only electricity market is extreme prices, which in turn is dependent on capacity requirements. However storage technologies can receive additional revenue streams, which may be improved by increased integration of renewable energy.},

One important inconvenience of these technologies is their intermittency of power generation. This variability of energy production leads to an increased need of services such as reliability, regulation and transmission congestion. In order to make the electric grid reliable and efficient, system operators have to deploy cost-effective ways to balance supply and demand in real time. Energy storage is considered a viable solution and can mitigate several problems. However, it is still unclear whether or not energy storage will generate enough profit by interacting with energy and ancillary markets. Current economic studies on the energy storage technologies are limited because they do not explore possibilities of using storage in arbitrage and ancillary services in both day-ahead and real time markets. This paper focuses on the economics of energy storage participating in arbitrage and regulation services within different markets.

	abstract = {The valuation of an electricity storage device is based on the expected future cash flow generated by the device. Two potential sources of income for an electricity storage system are energy arbitrage and participation in the frequency regulation market. Energy arbitrage refers to purchasing (storing) energy when electricity prices are low, and selling (discharging) energy when electricity prices are high. Frequency regulation is an ancillary service geared towards maintaining system frequency, and is typically procured by the independent system operator in some type of market. This paper outlines the calculations required to estimate the maximum potential revenue from participating in these two activities. First, a mathematical model is presented for the state of charge as a function of the storage device parameters and the quantities of electricity purchased/sold as well as the quantities offered into the regulation market. Using this mathematical model, we present a linear programming optimization approach to calculating the maximum potential revenue from an electricity storage device. The calculation of the maximum potential revenue is critical in developing an upper bound on the value of storage, as a benchmark for evaluating potential trading strategies, and a tool for capital finance risk assessment. Then, we use historical California Independent System Operator (CAISO) data from 2010-2011 to evaluate the maximum potential revenue from the Tehachapi wind energy storage project, an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) energy storage demonstration project. We investigate the maximum potential revenue from two different scenarios: arbitrage only and arbitrage combined with the regulation market. Our analysis shows that participation in the regulation market produces four times the revenue compared to arbitrage in the CAISO market using 2010 and 2011 data. Then we evaluate several trading strategies to illustrate how they compare to the maximum potential revenue benchmark. We conclude with a sensitivity analysis with respect to key parameters.},

	abstract = {This study analyzes power storage as a key option to support wind energy integration. The case study is the French power system, whose characteristics rely on high rates of nuclear power and a strong emerging wind energy market. A dynamic optimization dispatching model is used to simulate the operation of the power system, under two development scenarios of the technology mix by 2030, one scenario documented by European Commission, EC [1], and a second one by French Transmission System Operator, RTE [2]. Both scenarios result in power storage requirements of around 7 TWh for more than 4 GW installed storage capacity of pumped hydro power plants in France as a whole. In this context, it is assessed the profitability of an additional regional project of Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) located in the region of Bretagne. It shows how benefits could accrue by avoiding the regional wind curtailment of 59 GWh, by providing ancillary services such as secondary reserve, and by increasing the use of grid assets and the nuclear power output with more than 230 GWh. The profitability of the CAES project remains however negative, around -70 /MWh despite the social value and the system benefits that results in. The study assesses qualitatively possible ways to incentivize the investment in new storage projects, through for instance contracts for difference, which would link the storage operation, its investment cost and stage of development to the power market design via power prices and a pre-defined rate of return. The periodical revision of these regulatory arrangements would enable the storage investor to recover the investment cost and would eliminate the risk of over rewarding generators in the case of windfall profits. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy (namely wind energy and solar PV) may entail new challenges in power systems and more volatility in power prices in liberalized electricity markets. Energy storage can diminish this imbalance, relieving the grid congestion, and promoting distributed generation. The economic implications of grid-scale electrical energy storage technologies are however obscure for the experts, power grid operators, regulators, and power producers. A meticulous technoeconomic or cost-benefit analysis of electricity storage systems requires consistent, updated cost data and a holistic cost analysis framework. To this end, this study critically examines the existing literature in the analysis of life cycle costs of utility-scale electricity storage systems, providing an updated database for the cost elements (capital costs, operational and maintenance costs, and replacement costs). Moreover, life cycle costs and levelized cost of electricity delivered by electrical energy storage is analyzed, employing Monte Carlo method to consider uncertainties. The examined energy storage technologies include pumped hydropower storage, compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheel, electrochemical batteries (e.g. lead-acid, NaS, Li-ion, and Ni-Cd), flow batteries (e.g. vanadium-redox), superconducting magnetic energy storage, supercapacitors, and hydrogen energy storage (power to gas technologies). The results illustrate the economy of different storage systems for three main applications: bulk energy storage, T{\&}D support services, and frequency regulation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a detailed analysis of the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for different electricity storage technologies. Costs were analyzed for a long-term storage system (100 MW power and 70 GWh capacity) and a short-term storage system (100 MW power and 400 MWh capacity). Detailed data sets for the latest costs of four technology groups are provided in this paper. The LCOS method allows a cost comparison of technologies in different system designs and various operation modes. The results for the long-term storage show that Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity has the lowest LCOS among the mature technologies today. Power to Gas technologies, once established on the market, may also provide long-term electricity storage at even lower LCOS. Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity is also the cheapest technology for short-term storage systems. Battery systems at the moment still have high costs but are expected to have a sharp price decrease in the near future. Power to Gas and adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage systems may become cost competitive as short-term storage systems as well. The detailed analysis of the cost components shows that the cost composition is very inhomogeneous among the technologies. Plant design optimized to the application is therefore crucial for cost minimization. Sensitivity analysis shows that for most technologies the amount of energy discharged as well as the cost of electricity purchase are the most influential factors for the LCOS.},

	abstract = {With the increasing technological maturity and economies of scale for solar photovoltaic (PV) and electrical energy storage (EES), there is a potential for mass-scale deployment of both technologies in stand-alone and grid-connected power systems. The challenge arises in analyzing the economic projections on complex hybrid systems utilizing PV and EES. It is well known that PV power is of diurnal and stochastic nature, and surplus electrical energy is generally available in midday during high irradiance levels. EES does not produce energy as it is not a conventional generator source. Commonly, the cost of a generating asset or the power system is evaluated by using levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). In this paper, a new metric levelized cost of delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for the EES. A review on definitions in LCOE for PV hybrid energy systems is provided. Four years of solar irradiance data from Johannesburg and the national load data from Kenya are obtained for case studies. The proposed cost calculation methods are evaluated with two types of EES, namely Vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) and Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery. It shows that the marginal LCOE and LCOD indices can be used to assist policymakers to consider the discount rate, the type of storage technology and sizing of components in a PV-EES hybrid system.},

	abstract = {Installed capacity of renewable energy resources has increased dramatically in recent years, particularly for wind and photovoltaic solar. Concurrently, the costs of utility-scale electrical energy storage options have been decreasing, making inevitable a crossing point at which it will become economically viable to couple renewable energy generation with utility-scale storage systems. This paper proposes a methodology for calculating Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for utility-scale storage systems, with the intent of providing engineers, financiers and policy makers the means by which to evaluate disparate storage systems using a common economic metric. We discuss the variables influencing LCOE in detail, particularly those pertinent to electrical energy storage systems. We present results of LCOE calculations for various storage systems, specifically pumped hydro, compressed air, and chemical batteries, which we then compare with a more traditional arbitrage option, the simple-cycle combustion turbine. Federal and State government electrical energy storage tax incentives are considered as well. We also analyze the sensitivities of LCOE to several key variables using Monte Carlo analysis. Considering the downward-sloping cost trends of storage systems and the increased penetration levels of stochastic and non-dispatchable renewable resources, large-scale storage is becoming a significant issue for utilities, thus justifying the development of a levelized costing algorithm.},

Co-location of wind and storage decreases transmission requirements, but also decreases the economic value of energy storage compared to locating energy storage at the load. This represents a tradeoff which we examine to estimate the transmission costs required to justify moving storage from load-sited to wind-sited in three different locations in the United States. We examined compressed air energy storage (CAES) in three "wind by wire" scenarios with a variety of transmission and CAES sizes relative to a given amount of wind. In the sites and years evaluated, the optimal amount of transmission ranges from 60{\%} to 100{\%} of the wind farm rating, with the optimal amount of CAES equal to 0-35{\%} of the wind farm rating, depending heavily on wind resource, value of electricity in the local market, and the cost of natural gas. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Compressed air energy storage (CAES) technologies can be used for load levelling in the electricity supply and are therefore often considered for future energy systems with a high share of fluctuating renewable energy sources, such as e.g. wind power. In such systems, CAES plants will often operate on electricity spot markets by storing energy when electricity prices are low and producing electricity when prices are high. In order to make a profit on such markets, CAES plant operators have to identify proper strategies to decide when to sell and when to buy electricity. This paper describes three independent computer-based methodologies which may be used for identifying the optimal operation strategy for a given CAES plant, on a given spot market and in a given year. The optimal strategy is identified as the one which provides the best business-economic net earnings for the plant. In practice, CAES plants will not be able to achieve such optimal operation, since the fluctuations of spot market prices in the coming hours and days are not known. Consequently, two simple practical strategies have been identified and compared to the results of the optimal strategy. This comparison shows that, in practice, a CAES plant can be expected to earn 80-90 per cent of the optimal earnings. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We develop a co-optimized Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) dispatch model to characterize the value of providing operating reserves in addition to energy arbitrage in several U.S. markets. We use the model to: (1) quantify the added value of providing operating reserves in addition to energy arbitrage; (2) evaluate the dynamic nature of optimally allocating storage resources into energy and reserve markets; and (3) quantify the sensitivity of CAES net revenues to several design and performance parameters. We find that conventional CAES systems could earn an additional {\$}23 ± 10/kW-yr by providing operating reserves, and adiabatic CAES systems could earn an additional {\$}28 ± 13/kW-yr. We find that arbitrage-only revenues are unlikely to support a CAES investment in most market locations, but the addition of reserve revenues could support a conventional CAES investment in several markets. Adiabatic CAES revenues are not likely to support an investment in most regions studied. Modifying CAES design and performance parameters primarily impacts arbitrage revenues, and optimizing CAES design will be nearly independent of dispatch strategy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Simulations are performed to quantify the impacts of bulk energy storage in terms of reduction in market prices, system production and cycling costs, and also to investigate the economic viability of storage projects in terms of payback periods under increasing wind penetration levels.},

	abstract = {Battery storage technologies have developed to the point that some are mature enough to serve as a generation resource. However, whether a battery can generate profits by interacting solely in energy markets is unclear. Meanwhile, FERC order 784 requires electricity exchange markets in the U.S. to install the necessary technical equipment for batteries to supply ancillary services [12]. We suggest that current economic studies on the battery energy storage system (ESS) are limited because they do not explore possibilities to use battery storage in ancillary (reserve) markets. Applying battery ESS to ancillary service could be profitable enough to cover investment costs.In this study, we consider a battery storage operator's best strategy each day, using backwards induction. We analyze the storage device as an exhaustible resource with a limited number of charging cycles and operating years. Based on this approach, we build a revenue model to maximized the net present value of the battery energy storage system revenues by applying the three-staged-method employed by Shcherbakova et al. [14]. We found that the battery in unable to cover its costs, and it does not use all the cycles available in its lifetime. This result, however, may be a function of the limits of our analytical approach.},

The performances of the two methodologies are investigated by applying them to the data of a real household which owns a small solar photovoltaic installation. The benefits of storage and demand response are evaluated through an optimization analysis with a linear programming algorithm. The simulations are carried out both for real market prices of the equipment and for reduced ones, to simulate the case of strong technological development and the corresponding price decrease in the coming years. The electricity pricing scheme is a dual tariff regime modeled according to the Portuguese current rules. The results suggest that at the moment, demand response should be preferred with the current market prices of the hardware. However, a significant decrease in the batteries price can make storage an interesting alternative, especially for the cases in which demand response is not easily applicable.},

	abstract = {Large-scale battery storage will become an essential part of the future smart grid. This paper investigates the optimal bidding strategy for battery storage in power markets. Battery storage could increase its profitability by providing fast regulation service under a performance-based regulation mechanism, which better exploits a battery's fast ramping capability. However, battery life might be decreased by frequent charge-discharge cycling, especially when providing fast regulation service. It is profitable for battery storage to extend its service life by limiting its operational strategy to some degree. Thus, we incorporate a battery cycle life model into a profit maximization model to determine the optimal bids in day-ahead energy, spinning reserve, and regulation markets. Then a decomposed online calculation method to compute cycle life under different operational strategies is proposed to reduce the complexity of the model. This novel bidding model would help investor-owned battery storages better decide their bidding and operational schedules and investors to estimate the battery storage's economic viability. The validity of the proposed model is proven by case study results.},

	abstract = {The introduction of distributed energy resources (DER) is leading to significant changes in the way in which power systems are planned, operated and maintained. DER includes many different types of technology, ranging from producers of electricity such as microgeneration units to consumers of electricity such as heat pumps and electric vehicles. High penetrations of these new technologies are introducing new challenges for power systems as existing electricity networks were not originally designed to accommodate them. This thesis investigates the potential impact of DER in distribution systems, in particular low voltage residential networks, in terms of end-user voltage levels and thermal loading of network equipment. Deterministic and stochastic methods are used to analyse low voltage residential test networks. Acceptable penetration levels of various DER technology are assessed while maintaining the network within permissible operating limits. A stochastic assessment of the network with various penetration levels of DER is also performed to incorporate a number of the uncertainties associated with DER, such as time-of-use and energy requirements. In order to accommodate high penetrations of DER on existing low voltage distribution networks, a method for controlling their operation in a coordinated manner is proposed. The method controls the operation of DER units in order to fully utilise the available capacity of the network while maintaining acceptable operating limits. While the method is applicable to other forms of DER, electric vehicle technology is chosen to demonstrate the potential benefits. The technique is based on linear programming and determines the optimal charging rate for each electric vehicle in order to maximise the total power that can be delivered to all of the vehicles. The results show that high penetrations of electric vehicles can be accommodated on existing residential networks, thereby avoiding unnecessary network upgrades. The method for controlling DER operation described above is based on a centralised control scheme where a third-party operator has real-time knowledge of operating con- ditions at all points of the network. Implementing such a scheme would require a significant investment in communication infrastructure in order for the controller to receive and transmit charging rate commands to all electric vehicles on the network. As such, a distributed control technique is proposed whereby individual electric vehicle charging units attempt to maximise the charging rate for their vehicle while maintaining local network conditions within acceptable limits. The method would require less com- munications infrastructure than the centralised control method. Results demonstrate that the method is not as accurate as the centralised control technique at maintaining the network within acceptable operating limits and that distributed control charging schemes may only be sufficient for dealing with lower penetrations of electric vehicles or other forms of DER},

Energy storage (ES) represents a flexible option that can bring sig- nificant, fundamental economic benefits to various areas in the electric power sector, including reduced investment requirements for generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure as well as reduced system operation and balancing costs. The additional flexibility offered by ES could also significantly reduce the requirement for investment in low-carbon generation capacity while achieving the estab- lished carbon intensity targets. Moreover, ES may present significant option value, as it can provide flexibility for dealing with uncertainty in future system development. However, market and regulatory barriers may prevent the realization of quantifiable system value in cases where an ES asset cannot access the entire range of system services. Developing fully cost-reflec- tive markets and effective regulatory frameworks—achieved by establishing a level playing field between investment in traditional network/generation solutions and investment in ES—is therefore necessary to ensure that commercial incentives for investing in and operating ES are aligned with its societal benefit},

While much work has been done to detail what economic costs and benefits PHEVs will have on consumers and producers alike, it seems that it is also important to understand what impact PHEVs will have on distribution networks nationwide. This paper finds that the impact of PHEVs on the distribution network can be determined using the following aspects of PHEVs: driving patterns, charging characteristics, charge timing, and vehicle penetration. The impacts that these aspects of PHEVs will have on distribution networks have been measured and calculated by multiple authors in different locations using many different tools that range from analytical techniques to simulations and beyond. While much work has already been completed in this area, there is still much to do. Areas left for improvement and future work will include adding more stochasticity into models as well as computing and analyzing reliability indices with respect to distribution networks. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are expected to balance the fluctuation of renewable energy sources (RES). To investigate the contribution of PEVs, the availability of mobile battery storage and the control mechanism for load management are crucial. This study therefore combined the following: a stochastic model to determine mobility behavior, an optimization model to minimize vehicle charging costs and an agent-based electricity market equilibrium model to estimate variable electricity prices. The variable electricity prices are calculated based on marginal generation costs. Hence, because of the merit order effect, the electricity prices provide incentives to consume electricity when the supply of renewable generation is high. Depending on the price signals and mobility behavior, PEVs calculate a cost minimizing charging schedule and therefore balance the fluctuation of RES. The analysis shows that it is possible to limit the peak load using the applied control mechanism. The contribution of PEVs to improving the integration of intermittent renewable power generation into the grid depends on the characteristic of the RES generation profile. For the German 2030 scenario used here, the negative residual load was reduced by 15-22{\%} and the additional consumption of negative residual load was between 34 and 52{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

From the point of view of electric grids, PEVs are currently considered as simple loads due to their low market penetration. However, as the PEV fleet grows, implementation of an intelligent management system will be necessary in order to avoid large capital expenditures in network reinforcements and negative effects on electric distribution networks, such as: voltage deviations, transformers and lines saturations, increase of electrical losses, etc. These issues may jeopardize the safety and reliability of the grid. As a consequence, this topic has been researched in many papers where a wide range of solutions have been proposed. This paper presents a review of different strategies, algorithms and methods to implement a smart charging control system. Also significant projects around the world about PEVs integration are presented.

The concept goal of the smart grid along with the future deployment of the EVs puts forward various challenges in terms of electric grid infrastructure, communication and control. Following an intensive review on advanced smart metering and communication infrastructures, the strategy for integrating the EVs into the electric grid is presented. Various EV smart charging technologies are also extensively examined with the perspective of their potential, impacts and limitations under the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) phenomenon. Moreover, the high penetration of renewable energy sources (wind and photovoltaic solar) is soaring up into the power system. However, their intermittent power output poses different challenges on the planning, operation and control of the power system networks. On the other hand, the deployment of EVs in the energy market can compensate for the fluctuations of the electric grid. In this context, a literature review on the integration of the renewable energy and the latest feasible solution using EVs with the insight of the promising research gap to be covered up are investigated. Furthermore, the feasibility of the smart V2G system is thoroughly discussed. In this paper, the EVs interactions with the smart grid as the future energy system model are extensively discussed and research gap is revealed for the possible solutions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a detailed review of a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, in conjunction with various charging strategies of electric vehicles (EVs), and analyzes their impacts on power distribution networks. It is shown in this study that a vehicle, equipped with the ability of a V2G application, offers various features such as regulation of active power, support for reactive power, load balancing, current harmonics filtering etc. However, the technology of V2G also creates challenging issues, for instance, degradation of batteries, communication overhead between an EV and a grid, changes in whole infrastructure of a distribution network. In particular, the impacts of the EVs that are based on their penetration levels and charging profiles are discussed in detail. Moreover, an extensive analysis is also presented on coordinated/un-coordinated charging, delayed charging, off-peak charging and intelligent scheduling in a distribution network (DN). Our study also shows that the economic benefits of a V2G technology heavily depend on the strategies of charging and vehicle aggregation.},
