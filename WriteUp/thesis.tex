\chapter*{Abstract}
%\input{abstract}

With penetration of renewable energy resources and development of emerging technologies, the conventional power market regimes for managing and operating flexibility in power systems are being challenged. Regulators and power market designers are constantly revisiting and making changes to the rules, which leads to a highly disruptive business environment for players in power markets, especially for those whose scopes of business are across several power market jurisdictions.

This paper is therefore designed to solve this challenge for power market players by developing a framework for analysis and valuation of flexibility solutions in various power market regimes.

In this thesis, %we first mapped both the academic research and the real-world market regimes to provide a comprehensive and structured view on the topic. Based on that, 
we developed an analytical framework for qualitative analysis and a techno-economic model for quantitative valuation of flexibility solutions. The techno-economic model is built with a modular approach and is adaptive for various market regimes and several technologies. 

Furthermore, we carried out case studies in three power market jurisdictions, i.e. PJM Interconnection, Germany power market, and New South Wales in Australia's National Electricity Market. It is found that these three markets have heterogeneous structures and are at different stages in terms of implementing frameworks for emerging flexibility solutions. In the quantitative studies, it is noticed that except for explicit market rules, there are implicit barriers that may be unfavorable for some flexibility solutions, making the markets not fully open for them. Further to specific technologies, the profitability of two types of flexibility solutions, i.e. battery energy storage systems and electric vehicle to grid was studied.  Results show that batteries are still costly and not profitable in the near future even with drastic cost reduction. However, in case where the costs for batteries are not responsible by market players, such as electric vehicle to grid technology, positive profitability is seen. With the number of electric vehicle growing rapidly, it reveals a promising business area. Finally, we investigated the impacts of renewable penetration, which are found to depend on power market regimes as well.

This thesis is designed to support strategic business planning, primarily for technology vendor but also for all market players that are interested in flexibility solutions with a cross-regional perspective.
