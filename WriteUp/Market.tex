\chapter{Power Markets and The Role of Flexibility Management}
\label{ch:market}
\textit{This chapter introduces some key concepts of power market elements and how the role of flexiblity management is determined by them. We adopted a generalized method to extract the key variances in power market structures that have impacts on value of flexiblity management. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the managment of a technology vendor who plan to expand their business in a variety of geographies a comprehensive and comparative view on flexiblity managment in different power market regimes.}

\section{Power market frameworks: a comparative analysis}

Started in the 1980s and facilitated in 1990s, liberalized power markets has been the mainstream worldwide, especially in developed countries where the constructions of power infrastructure have been largely completed. \cite{Srivastava2011} %book
Nowadays, there are many maturely existing liberalized power markets. However, since different preconditions exists in different countries due to historical, political and climatical reasons, the structure of their power markets tend to be very heterogeneous. Moreover, with the development of technologies, for instance the renewable penetration and rise of demand response as well as electricity storage, power markets face pending or undergoing restructuring, make them a rapidly changing field of the economy. \cite{Ziel2015}

These spatial and temporal variances bring great challenges to our study as the business models of flexiblity managment and values out of them depend extensively on the power market structure. Hereby we reviewed and analyzed the existing mechanisms of how power makets can possibly enable the value creation of flexiblity management. Proposing novel market mechanisms is out of the scope of our study.
